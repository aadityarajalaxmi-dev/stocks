## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **React Native**: Cross-platform mobile development
- **Expo**: Development platform and tools
- **yfinance**: Yahoo Finance API for stock data
- **React Native Paper**: Material Design components
- **React Native SVG**: SVG support for charts
- **Expo Vector Icons**: Icon library

### Architecture
- **Services**: `stockService.js` - Handles all stock data operations
- **Utils**: `fibonacciUtils.js` - Fibonacci calculations and formatting
- **Components**: 
  - `StockWatchlist.js` - Main watchlist display
  - `StockSelector.js` - Stock search and selection
  - `FibonacciLevels.js` - Fibonacci analysis display

### Data Flow
1. StockService manages the watchlist and fetches data from yfinance
2. Components subscribe to data updates via callbacks
3. Live updates are fetched every 10 seconds
4. Fibonacci levels are calculated from 3-month historical data

## API Limitations

- **yfinance**: Free API with rate limits
- **Data Delay**: Some data may have a 15-20 minute delay
- **Availability**: Depends on Yahoo Finance API availability

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No stocks found" when searching**
   - Try different stock symbols
   - Check your internet connection
   - Some symbols may not be available

2. **"Failed to load Fibonacci data"**
   - Ensure the stock has sufficient historical data
   - Check internet connection
   - Try refreshing the data

3. **App crashes on startup**
   - Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
   - Delete node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

### Performance Tips
- Limit your watchlist to 10-15 stocks for optimal performance
- Close the app when not in use to save battery
- Use WiFi when possible for better data updates

## Future Enhancements
